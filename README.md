This is a hangman game set in the Twin Peaks universe! By pressing any letter you make your first attempt at guessing the name of a multitude of characters.You only get 10 wrong letters so you better be familiar. 

Once the game is won or lost the text will change and a reset button will appear to send you back to the start. If you win however you it will give you a notch in the win column. You also get a nice picture of the person you guessed!
